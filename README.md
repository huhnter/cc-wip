Work in progress of Cookie Clicker made in python.
Several issues at hand: No custom images, things aren't centered perfectly either.
I think a lot of my future work on this is going to be focused on pretty-ing things up.
Although, it is working properly, just kinda laggy (idk if thats because of turtle or refresh rate)
Also moving forward, I would like to add "more" to it, whether its more upgrades or something else I'm not sure.
